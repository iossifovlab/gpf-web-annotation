position	1265232
reference	G
alternative	A
dbSNP_RS		dbSNP ID (i.e. rs number)
gnomad_v4_exome_ALL_af		Alternate allele frequency
gnomad_v4_genome_ALL_af		Alternate allele frequency
CLNSIG		Aggregate germline classification for this single variant; multiple values are separated by a vertical bar
CLNDN		ClinVar's preferred disease name for the concept specified by disease identifiers in CLNDISDB
cadd_raw		CADD raw score for functional prediction of a SNP. The larger the score  the more likely the SNP has damaging effect
cadd_phred		CADD phred-like score. This is phred-like rank score based on whole genome CADD raw scores. The larger the score the more likely the SNP has damaging effect.
